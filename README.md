# Database, webapp and API for fictional NE Railway system
This is more or less a proof of concept/use case of a datasbase for a train system - originally a school project,
along with the web app and API endpoints (which I added to make things more interesting)

Everything is in Python (2.7)
The web server is implemented with Flask (`pip install flask`)
And the API endpoint is with FLask RESTful (`pip install flask_restful`)
Running is simple: `python run.py`

An accompanying Android App that takes advantage of the API is in the works.
